# Web and Databse Technology Projects

This reposiory holds all of this groups work on the projects for TU Delft's web and database technology class. The project has been completed. This repository houses all of the source code for assignments 1 - 3. To run these files node.js and all other dependencies must be installed in the root folder, as it was too many to be reasonably uploaded. Make sure that you install node.js, npm, express, and ws for the websocket dependencies. To start a local server run npm start in the root folder once everything has been installed.

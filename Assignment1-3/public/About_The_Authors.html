                                    -This game has a defined style
                                    <br>
                                    -It has an interesting board, and sufficient texures on the pawns.
                                    <br>
                                    -The UI and information about the game is a bit limeted
                                    <br>

                                <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
                                <p>
                                    There are two game elements for which I have used object design Patterns.
                                    <br>
                                    -The player
                                    <br>
                                    -The game 
                                    <br>
                                    Both of these are implemented as different objects using the standard object constructor. The game constructor calls the player constructor. 
                                    The feilds of the created object are later filled as players join and information is sent back from the clients
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class = 'right shorter'>
                                <h3>Plan of Action</h3>
                                <p>
                                    -The dice must return a random number between 1 and 6
                                    <br>
                                    -Only one pawn is allowed to be selected at a time
                                    <br>
                                    -Each player has the choice of which color they want
                                    <br>
                                    -A player cannot choose an already chosen color
                                    <br>
                                    -There is a button to confirm the players choice of action
                                    <br>
                                    -There are mutliple different peices of text dynamically shown
                                </p>
                            </div>
